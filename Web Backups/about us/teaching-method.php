					<h1>Teaching Method</h1>
					
					<h2>How Students Are Taught</h2>
					<p>
						The <strong>Arthur Murray Franchised Dance Studio</strong> has found that students learn most quickly 
						and effectively on a scholastic basis. Your introductory program is the first student 
						level. You will be taught the basic patterns of the most <strong>popular dances</strong> today. Your 
						instructor will explain how the Medal Standards are taught and will plan a personalized 
						program to fulfill your specific needs and desires.					</p>
<p>
						The degree of dancing you will achieve varies depending on your desire, goals, commitment 
						and interest. After your Introductory Program the dance levels (degrees) progress from 
						Associate and Full Medallist programs in Bronze, Silver, Gold and Gold Bar Standards.
						(See <a href="<?= $mosConfig_live_site ?>/getting-started/programs-and-standards.php">Dance Programs</a>) These courses are designed for people like yourself who desire a 
						fundamental foundation or more advanced training in the social, as well as competitive 
						(dance sport) styles.					</p>
			  <p>
						The majority of students who come to an Arthur Murray Dance Studio are interested in 
						becoming good social dancers and our medallist programs will help you achieve that goal. 
						If competitive dancing (dance sport) is your desire, Arthur Murray Dance Studios can train 
						you in the latest technique, steps and styles. Indeed, we boast some of the top competitive 
						couples in the world today.
					</p>

					<h2>Our Instructors</h2>
					<p>
						Our instructors are carefully selected and thoroughly trained in the exclusive Arthur Murray 
						teaching method. This assures you the finest instruction in dancing. You will have a regular 
						 dance teacher who will be responsible for your progress. Periodically, you will have 
						exchange lessons with other teachers which will give you experience and practice in adapting 
						to a variety of dance partners and dance styles.					</p>
					
				  <h2>Private Lessons</h2>
					<p>
						During your <strong>one-on-one private lessons</strong>, you will receive personalized instruction that will
						 help you achieve your goals in dancing. Your instructor will spend the time necessary on 
						 technique, styling and general dance improvement. An up-to-date record of everything you 
						 have learned will also be kept as part of your instruction.					</p>
					
				  <h2>Group Lessons</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Group lesson</strong>s are an important addendum to your private instruction. They give you the 
						opportunity to dance with a variety of partners, develop good dance habits and meet other 
						students in the studio. Group lessons are held for different dances and levels. Please ask 
						your teacher for the schedule and take advantage of another fine way to help you become a 
						more proficient and confident dancer.					</p>
					
				  <h2>Practice Parties</h2>
					<p>
						We hold Scheduled dance parties (practice sessions) for all our students. These practice 
						parties are held on a weekly basis on Wednesday and Friday nights. You will have fun dancing 
						with the instructors and students in a relaxed and comfortable environment. This gives you 
						the opportunity to practice and try out all the new dance skills that you've learned in your 
						Private and Group Lessons.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Medal Ball</h2>
					<p>
						An Arthur Murray Medal Ball is a gala dance event honoring students who "graduate" from 
						one level of their dance program to the next. Medal Ball also affords students the 
						opportunity to enjoy their dancing in a fun and elegant setting.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Showcase</h2>
					<p>
						A Showcase is a one-day event where students present dance routines with personalized 
						choreography. These routines make an exciting addition to your Medallist Program because 
						they allow you to develop showmanship and musical expression along with social dance skills.
					</p>
					
					<h2>Dance-O-Rama ( Dance Sport )</h2>
					<p>
						A Dance-O-Rama (or Dance Sport Competition) is an exciting two or three day event that brings 
						students together from many Arthur Murray studios to compete, at their level, in dances of 
						their choice. This requires specialized dance training to polish and perfect choreography, 
						technique and style. The weekend is full of activities such as dance competitions, cocktail 
						parties, dinner dances and exciting professional shows.
